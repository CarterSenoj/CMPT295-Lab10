1. What was the running time of the dot product implementations?
   Assembly vs the compiler, and single- vs double-precision?

Assembly and C are very very close in run time on my laptop being
40.7ms vs 41.4ms for doubles and 33.3ms vs 30.8ms. I also notice that
with single the C code is faster than the asm and vice versa for double.
Single precision is ~25% faster than double precision in this test.

2. Same question, but for the polynomial evaluation? 
(Prediction: the differences should be much more obvious here.)

The asm is much slower than the C versions with 222.5ms vs 77.8 for double 
precision and 175.3ms vs 85.3ms for single. I assume this to be because 
the compiler is just that much better at optimizing this operation. 


3. What is the relative running time of the x87-based sine calculation vs the C implementation (that uses its own implementation of the function)?
I tested with different array sizes from 100,000 - 100,000,000. With a small array size (100,000) I noticed that the asm code was faster, however, 
as I added more array elements the C code quickly surpassed the asm code and the asm code because much less useable. Im sure these
results continue with larger arrays but when I tried 1 billion it forced a SIGKILL in my terminal and I left it here.
